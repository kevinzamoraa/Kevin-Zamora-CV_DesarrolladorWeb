# Writer's Bookstore
In this project, I'm developing a bookstore using HTML, CSS and, later on, Python and Django.

The idea is to create a portfolio/bookstore for one specific author to show and sell their work via, initially, PayPal. 

The customer can login, add products to cart and buy the products of their choice.

# Getting Started

In order to open and edit this website, you need to have a Code Editor installed in your PC. Once that is done, download the file and open it in your editor. If you have Visual Code Studio, you can right click the file and select the "Open with Code" option.
